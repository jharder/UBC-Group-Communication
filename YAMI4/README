- Initial test with messaging using YAMI system.
- Created single client-server program which sends a message to the server and replies back to the client
- Will use this as a basis for sending more complex packets in the form of frames of a video from server to client
- Need to consider looking at publisher-subscriber model?  Or should the server continually send out the video and let the client decide when to join?
