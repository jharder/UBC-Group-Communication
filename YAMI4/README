Nov 07, 2011 (second update):
- Video looping enabled (see VideoStream.java)
- Video streams at ~24fps (normal NTSC speed)
- Server/client hard-coded to use my local IP. Change binding address to test

Nov 07, 2011:
- Pub-sub video streaming enabled
- Client receives frames from server and properly displays them
- Issue found where server crashes once EOF is found in video
- Need to cause video streaming to loop

Nov 05, 2011:
- Initial test with messaging using YAMI system.
- Created single client-server program which sends a message to the server and replies back to the client
- Will use this as a basis for sending more complex packets in the form of frames of a video from server to client
- Need to consider looking at publisher-subscriber model?  Or should the server continually send out the video and let the client decide when to join?

Oct 26, 2011:
- Initial update by Jared Harder. Will add files in coming days.
- Finished documenting GitHub specific commands and sent email.
